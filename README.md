# Analysis of 2020 Stack Overflow Developers Survey

## Project Motivation

The collaboration platform Stack Overflow has been conducted annual surveys for a decade now. These are the largest and the most comprehensive surveys of developers ever conducted. The anonymized results of the surveys are publicly available for analysis at [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

The 2020 Stack Overflow Survey was conducted in February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic affected the entire world and it involved almost 65K developers from 184 countries and regions. The survey consists of 60 questions distributed over six areas of interest.  

The present project serves two purposes. On one side, I am interested in learning more about the developers who work with big data, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, data and business analysts, and data engineers. I call them data coders or data developers for short. On the other side, this is a showcase project for three different approaches encountered when working with data.

In this analysis I will investigate the following three questions:

1. Do data coders have more formal educational background than the other coders?  
2. How does the salary of data coders compare with the salary of the other coders?
3. Predict the job satisfaction of a data coder and determine the key factors affecting it.

## Project Description

### 1. Educational background of data developers

The first question is investigated in the notebook `stackBlogQuestion1.ipynb` using EDA and in particular visualizations.

### 2. Salaries comparison of data and other developers

To address the second question, I use standard statistical methods. I conduct a Z-test for independent means to compare the averages of the converted compensation for data developers and other developers. This hypothesis test and the necessary data preparation can be found in the notebook `stackBlogQuestion2.ipynb`.

### 3. Job satisfaction prediction for data developers

The modeling part of the project is developed in the notebook `stackBlogQuestion3.ipynb`.
The process follows the CRISP-DM methodology which is detailed in the notebook. This is a multi-label classification problem for 5 levels of job satisfaction. After data preprocessing, data processing and feature engineering, a best performing classifier is chosen via KFold cross validation. The final model consists of a RandomForestClassifier whose parameters are tuned with RandomizedSearchCV.

## Results

The outcomes for each question are outlined in the corresponding notebooks. A non-technical compilation of the most relevant results is available in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@silviaonofrei/who-are-the-data-professionals-b81456dac51b).

## Requirements

The project is written in Jupyter notebooks, using Anaconda3 and Python 3.7.6. The following packages have to be imported:  

        numpy == 1.19.2  
        pandas == 1.2.4  
        scipy == 1.6.2  
        scikit_learn == 0.24.2  
        xgboost == 0.90  

The list of packages was obtained using Pigar.
